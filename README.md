# Credit Risk Assessment Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based system to assess the credit risk of customers using financial and demographic information. The goal is to support lending decisions by predicting the likelihood of default in a transparent and data-driven manner.

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions must evaluate customer creditworthiness accurately to reduce default risk. Manual assessment is time-consuming and prone to bias, while raw datasets often contain irrelevant or highly correlated features that reduce model performance and interpretability.

## Solution Approach
- Preprocessed customer data to handle missing values and inconsistencies  
- Applied statistical feature selection techniques such as Chi-square, ANOVA, and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)  
- Trained multiple machine learning models to predict credit risk  
- Optimized model performance using grid search with cross-validation  
- Visualized results to support business decision-making  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Visualization & UI:** Streamlit  

## Key Features
- Interpretable feature selection pipeline  
- Automated model tuning and evaluation  
- Interactive credit risk prediction interface  
- Clear performance metrics for comparison  

## Outcome
The system improves credit risk prediction accuracy while maintaining interpretability. It demonstrates practical application of machine learning, statistical analysis, and model optimization techniques in a real-world financial risk assessment scenario.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporating real-time customer data  
- Deploying advanced ensemble models  
- Adding explainability tools such as SHAP for model insights
